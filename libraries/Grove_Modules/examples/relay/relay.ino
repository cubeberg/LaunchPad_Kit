/* Macro Define */
#define RELAY_PIN 39

/* the setup() method runs once, when the sketch starts */
void setup() { 
  pinMode(RELAY_PIN, OUTPUT); // initialize the digital pin as an output. 
}

/* the loop() method runs over and over again */
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH); // turn the relay on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);   // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);   // turn the relay off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);   // wait for a second
}
